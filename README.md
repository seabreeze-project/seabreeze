# Seabreeze

Seabreeze is a really simple container orchestration tool with superpowers, optimized for the management of web applications.

It serves as a "poor man's Kubernetes" while also providing a comprehensive set of utilities for containerized environments.

**Please note that Seabreeze is currently under heavy development. We are open to and deeply thankful for constructive feedback, innovative ideas, and any kind of code contributions.** Your input can help shape the future of this project and make it more useful for the community. Please join the discussions in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/seabreeze-project/seabreeze/issues).

## Features

- üöÄ **Project Management:** Easily create and manage multiple compose projects.
- üìú **Script Runner:** Run predefined commands within containers and on the host.
- üêö **Shell Mode (WIP):** Run Seabreeze commands in an interactive shell-like interface.

### Planned Features

- üîÄ **VCS Integration:** Clone and update source code that is used for service containers.
- ‚è∞ **Tasks (Cronjobs):** Automatically run commands in containers based on a defined schedule.
- üîê **Docker API Proxy:** Control and restrict access to Docker endpoints.
- üìö **Recipes:** Automatically set up projects using predefined workflows.

## History

Seabreeze is a project that has evolved organically over time. It began as a collection of scripts I developed to simplify the management of containerized applications. These scripts were eventually rewritten in Go, and refined to work together seamlessly. Over this period, I accumulated several unimplemented ideas that aligned perfectly with the scope of Seabreeze. These ideas are now finding a home within this ecosystem, with the potential to be implemented in the future.

The name "Seabreeze" itself has a bit of history too. It was inspired by an older, somewhat similar tool I had created. This project name carries forward the essence of that earlier tool, now refined and expanded into a more powerful and versatile solution.
